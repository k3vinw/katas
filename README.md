## Q & A

Q: What was the hardest part of the implementation?

A:
  * Designing login while being new to the framework.
  * Getting the design to feel right.
  * Learning that Git is your friend. It gave me the freedom to experiment and rollback when I needed to hit
    the reset button.

Q: What would be your next couple of tasks if you had more time?

A: 
  * Finish first business requirement (login feature).
  * Update test coverage after some rapid schema changes.
  * Finish second business objective (managing orders as pharmacy or courier).
    - Implementing dashboards for pharmacies and couriers so that order can be managed.

Q: How could we change the project to be more interesting?

A:
  * Well, I didn't expect login to be so challenging, but that perfectly reflects real life. So I wouldn't
    change it. I would suggest if the framework makes this easier in the future that you update the code
    challenge accordingly to keep things interesting.
